Yu-Ning Wang joined Purple Mountain Observatory in 2023 as a graduate student. Her research aims to decode signatures of dark matter within cosmic evolution history.
Spanning from recombination to reionization, she works on the possible signatures of diverse dark matter candidate models using cosmological probes such as the CMB and 21-cm signals.
