Xinchen Duan joined Purple Mountain Observatory as a graduate student in 2022 and is currently pursuing her Ph.D. in astrophysics. Her research focuses on theoretical cosmology and the phenomenology of dark matter.
She has worked on the precise computation of the dark matter relic abundance, particularly in scenarios that go beyond standard thermal freeze-out. At present, she is studying the impact of dissipative dark matter on the formation of cosmic linear structures, using modified Boltzmann codes to investigate how hidden-sector interactions shape early Universe evolution.
In the future, she plans to constrain dark matter phenomenology using a variety of observational datasets, including those from CSST, JWST, and weak gravitational lensing surveys. In addition to this, she is also interested in exploring the role of  dark matter in the formation and evolution of late-time cosmic structures, combining linear theory with N-body simulations.
