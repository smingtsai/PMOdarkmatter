My research focuses on the phenomenology of dark matter, where I merge theoretical model predictions with experimental data analysis to investigate the nature of dark matter particles. I am adept at integrating studies on intricate high-dimensional theoretical models with empirical data, statistical analysis, and numerical simulations. My current research pursuits include a wide range of interests, such as indirect and direct observations of dark matter, dark matter cosmology involving the application of model predictions for linear evolution and N-body simulations for nonlinear evolution, as well as various dark matter particle model tests.
