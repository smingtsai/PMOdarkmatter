<font size="6">Research Interests</font>

I specialize in gravitational lensing and its applications to probing the nature and distribution of dark matter.

Now, focus on developing lensing‐based diagnostics for distinguishing between cold, warm, and self‐interacting dark matter scenarios and constraining the small‐scale structure of dark halos through strong‐lensing image anomalies.

In the future, I want to explore combining N-body simulations with gravitational lensing techniques to study the properties of dark matter more effectively. Furthermore, I Exploring the application of deep learning and AI for expanding related research.
