Dr. Yang Li completed his Bachelor's degree at Chongqing University before earning his PhD from the Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
His doctoral research focused on the evolution of the early universe, using lattice simulations to investigate phenomena
such as phase transitions, gravitational waves, topological defects, and dark matter.
As a postdoctoral researcher, Dr. Li will focus on particle astrophysics and cosmology,
with a particular emphasis on multi-messenger detection of dark matter.
