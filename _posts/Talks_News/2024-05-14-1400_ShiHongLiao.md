### Abstract:

Supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries within galaxy mergers are the primary target for low-frequency gravitational wave (GW) observatories. Understanding the coalescence process of SMBH binaries in a cosmological framework is pivotal for accurate GW predictions. However,traditional galaxy formation simulations often merge SMBHs instantaneously at kpc or sub-kpc separation scales due to resolution limitations,leading to significant uncertainty in estimating SMBH coalescence time-scales. In this talk,I will introduce the KETJU code,a newly developed numerical tool capable of simultaneously following galaxy (hydro-)dynamics and resolving SMBH dynamics with post-Newtonian corrections down to a few tens of Schwarzschild radii. Based on this novel numerical tool,our on-goingRABBITSseries simulations will improve the estimation of the SMBH merger time-scales and ultimately enhance our predictions of GW event rates and the stochastic background.
