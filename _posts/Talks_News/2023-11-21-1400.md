### Abstract:

We scrutinize the hypothesis that gauge singlet fermions - sterile neutrinos - interact with Standard Model particles through the transition magnetic moment portal. These interactions lead to the production of sterile neutrinos in supernovae followed by their decay into photons and active neutrinos which can be detected at -ray telescopes and neutrino detectors, respectively. We examine the implications from the non-observation of active neutrinos and photons from sterile-neutrino decay associated to SN1987A and near-future galactic supernova explosion. We will further discuss the indirect tests of parameter spaces for the transition magnetic moment portal within a specific UV model.
