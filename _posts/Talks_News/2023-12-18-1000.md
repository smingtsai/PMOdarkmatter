### Abstract:

I will discuss recent advancements in N-body simulations of self-interacting dark matter and their implications for the latest astrophysical observations of diverse galactic systems, including spiral galaxies, ultra-diffuse galaxies, and satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. I will highlight the novel signatures of gravothermal collapse in dark matter halos and explore their detection possibilities through observations of strong lensing systems and supermassive black holes. Additionally, I will briefly discuss the report from the US Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel.
