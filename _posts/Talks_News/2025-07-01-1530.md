### 报告摘要:
Here I present a framework named aLCDM to explain recently reported cosmological anomalies, including dynamical dark energy and isotropic cosmic birefringence. We introduces an ultralight axion field under the LCDM model. The cosmic evolution of the axion explains the dynamics of the dark energy and give rise to cosmic birefringence through Chern-Simons-type coupling. Combing the recent BAO data collected by DESI and DES, we find that there is a prefence in the negative cosmological constant scenario, which shall result in a crunch in the future. We estimate the lifespan of our universe to be 34 billion years.

### 报告人简介:
Dr. Yu-Cheng QIU graduated from Soochow University with his bachelor’s degree in 2017 followed by his PhD in The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2022. Currently he holds a postdoctoral position at Tsung-Dao Lee Institute at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. His research mainly focuses on particle theory and cosmology, with special interests in the axion and sphaleron.
