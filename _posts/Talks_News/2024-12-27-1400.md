### 报告摘要:
Strongly interacting dark particles have been studied as dark matter candidates, when they regulate their relic abundance through N-to-2 annihilation, and address astrophysical small-scale puzzles. A reasonable consequence of relatively strong dark interaction is the formation of bound states, if the interaction is attractive. I will discuss the potential roles of bound state in the dark sector, focusing on how it can significantly modify dark matter freeze-out processes. 


### 报告人简介:
Xiaoyong Chu, specializing in dark matter physics and particle physics phenomenology, received Ph.D. in 2013 from Universite libre de Bruxelles, and conducted postdoctoral research at ICTP-Trieste (2013-2016). Then he worked as a postdoctoral researcher (2016-2020) and then a permanent research associate (2021-2024) at the Institute of High Energy Physics in Austria. Now he is an associate professor at ICTP-AP in the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS).
